# Minimum Viable Go

> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

A team at Google developed Go in 2007 and the language was released publicly in 2009. The language was originally developed as a systems programming language and has syntactic similarity to C-derived languages. While taking some syntax from C, Go also adopted conventions from dynamic languages to make the code easier to read and understand. Simplicity was a stated goal of the project. Go features built in concurrency, a native package manager, and an extensive standard library.

This chapter covers the basics of the language to get started with the material. New pieces of the programming language are introduced as they are needed throughout the text.

## Getting set up

Find the instructions to install and configure Go on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

I will point out that you should ensure that you have set your `GOPATH` environment variable is set to your working directory.

As stated in the introduction, I recommend [GitHub's Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor if you do not already have a preferred text editor.
