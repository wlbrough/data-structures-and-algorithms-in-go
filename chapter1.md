# Minimum Viable Go

A team at Google developed Go in 2007 and the language was released publicly in 2009. The language was originally developed as a systems programming language and has syntactic similarity to C-derived languages. While taking some syntax from C, Go also adopted conventions from dynamic languages to make the code easier to read and understand. Simplicity was a stated goal of the project. Go features built in concurrency, a native package manager, and an extensive standard library.

## Getting set up

Find the instructions to install and configure Go on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

I will point out that you should ensure that you have set your `GOPATH` environment variable is set to your working directory.

As stated in the introduction, I recommend [GitHub's Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor if you do not already have a preferred text editor.
